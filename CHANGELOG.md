# Changelog

See the [releases for scri.be](https://github.com/scribe-org/scri.be/releases) for an up to date list of versions and their release dates.

Scribe tries to follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), a MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH version where increments are made of the:

- MAJOR version when we make incompatible API changes
- MINOR version when we add functionality in a backwards compatible manner
- PATCH version when we make backwards compatible bug fixes

Emojis for the following are chosen based on [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/).

# [Upcoming] scri.be 1.0.0
