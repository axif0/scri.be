> - Make sure the [Vue.js plugin](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-plugins/tree/master/vuejs) and [JavaScript Debugger](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/configuring-javascript-debugger.html) are enabled in the plugins page of the settings
>
> </p>
> </details>

2. To setup your development environment, first install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

> [!NOTE]
> If you are new to Docker, as an alternative Scribe recommends installing [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/). Docker Desktop comes with many Docker tools and a straightforward user interface.

3. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the [scri.be repo](https://github.com/scribe-org/scri.be), clone your fork, and configure the remotes:

> [!NOTE]
>
> <details><summary>Consider using SSH</summary>
>
> <p>
>
> Alternatively to using HTTPS as in the instructions below, consider SSH to interact with GitHub from the terminal. SSH allows you to connect without a user-pass authentication flow.
>
> To run git commands with SSH, remember then to substitute the HTTPS URL, `https://github.com/...`, with the SSH one, `git@github.com:...`.
>
> - e.g. Cloning now becomes `git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/scri.be.git`
>
> GitHub also has their documentation on how to [Generate a new SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) ðŸ”‘
>
> </p>
> </details>

```bash
# Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory.
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/scri.be.git
# Navigate to the newly cloned directory.
cd scri.be
# Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream".
git remote add upstream https://github.com/scribe-org/scri.be.git
```

- Now, if you run `git remote -v` you should see two remote repositories named:
  - `origin` (forked repository)
  - `upstream` (scri.be repository)

4. Create a virtual environment for the developer tools, activate it and install dependencies:

    ```bash
    # Unix or MacOS:
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # Windows:
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate.bat

    # After activating venv:
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    ```

5. Start your docker images with the following:

   ```bash
   # --build only necessary with new dependencies or backend model changes.
   docker compose --env-file .env.dev up --build

   # And to stop the containers when you're done working:
   docker compose --env-file .env.dev down
   ```

6. You can visit <http://localhost:3000/> to see the development frontend once the container is up and running.

> [!NOTE]
> Feel free to contact the team in the [Web room on Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#scri.be:matrix.org) if you're having problems getting your environment setup!

7. Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to ensure that each of your commits is properly checked against our linter and formatters:

   ```bash
   # In the project root:
   pre-commit install
   ```

> [!NOTE]
> pre-commit is Python package that can be installed via pip or any other Python package manager. You can also find it in our [requirements.txt](backend/requirements.txt) file.
>
> ```bash
> pip install pre-commit
> ```

<a id="style-guide-"></a>

## Style guide [`â‡§`](#contents)

Please see the [scri.be style guide](STYLEGUIDE.md) for details about how to follow the code style for the project. We made these guidelines to assure that we as a community write clean, cohesive code that's easy to write and review. Suggestions for the style guide are welcome.

<a id="linting-"></a>

## Linting [`â‡§`](#contents)

For the frontend [eslint](https://eslint.org/), [eslint-vue](https://eslint.vuejs.org/) and [vue-a11y](https://vue-a11y.github.io/eslint-plugin-vuejs-accessibility/) are added via the dependencies to provide linting support.

<a id="testing-"></a>

## Testing [`â‡§`](#contents)

### Frontend

#### Static Testing

Please check the formatting of your code using Prettier and run the static type check with eslint before pull requests with the following command:

```bash
# Within ./frontend:
yarn format
yarn lint
```

You can further run the following commands for TypeScript type checks on the frontend:

```bash
# Within ./frontend:
yarn run postinstall
yarn typecheck
```

> [!NOTE]
> Pre-existing TS errors may be ignored. If you need assistance then feel free to open a PR and we'll support!

#### Automated Testing

We use [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for component and unit testing.  You can run them with the following command:

```bash
# Within ./frontend:
yarn test
```

<a id="issues-projects"></a>

# Issues and projects [`â‡§`](#contents)

The [issue tracker for scri.be](https://github.com/scribe-org/scri.be/issues) is the preferred channel for [bug reports](#bug-reports), [features requests](#feature-requests) and [submitting pull requests](#pull-requests). Scribe also organizes related issues into [projects](https://github.com/scribe-org/scri.be/projects).

> [!NOTE]
> Just because an issue is assigned on GitHub doesn't mean the team isn't open to your contribution! Feel free to write [in the issues](https://github.com/scribe-org/scri.be/issues) and we can potentially reassign it to you.

Be sure to check the [`-next release-`](https://github.com/scribe-org/scri.be/labels/-next%20release-) and [`-priority-`](https://github.com/scribe-org/scri.be/labels/-priority-) labels in the [issues](https://github.com/scribe-org/scri.be/issues) for those that are most important, as well as those marked [`good first issue`](https://github.com/scribe-org/scri.be/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) that are tailored for first-time contributors.

<a id="bug-reports"></a>

# Bug reports [`â‡§`](#contents)

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** to check if the issue has already been reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** by trying to reproduce it using the latest `main` or development branch in the repository.

3. **Isolate the problem** to make sure that the code in the repository is _definitely_ responsible for the issue.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary
- Steps to reproduce
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (why this might be happening, things tried that didn't work, etc)

To make the above steps easier, the Scribe team asks that contributors report bugs using the [bug report](https://github.com/scribe-org/scri.be/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature&template=bug_report.yml) template, with these issues further being marked with the [`Bug`](https://github.com/scribe-org/scri.be/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20type%3ABug) type.

Again, thank you for your time in reporting issues!

<a id="feature-requests"></a>

# Feature requests [`â‡§`](#contents)

Feature requests are more than welcome! Please take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. When making a suggestion, provide as much detail and context as possible, and further make clear the degree to which you would like to contribute in its development. Feature requests are marked with the [`Feature`](https://github.com/scribe-org/scri.be/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20type%3AFeature) type, and can be made using the [feature request](https://github.com/scribe-org/scri.be/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature&template=feature_request.yml) template.

<a id="pull-requests"></a>

# Pull requests [`â‡§`](#contents)

Good pull requests - patches, improvements and new features - are the foundation of our community making scri.be. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits. Note that all contributions to this project will be made under [the specified license](LICENSE.txt) and should follow the code style standards ([contact us](https://matrix.to/#/#scribe_community:matrix.org) if unsure).

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (implementing features, refactoring code, etc), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the developers might not want to merge into the project. With that being said, major additions are very appreciated!

When making a contribution, adhering to the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) process is the best way to get your work merged:

1. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:

   ```bash
   git checkout <dev-branch>
   git pull upstream <dev-branch>
   ```

2. Create a new topic branch (off the main project development branch) to contain your feature, change, or fix:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
   ```

3. Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to ensure that each of your commits is properly checked against our linter and formatters:

   ```bash
   # In the project root:
   pre-commit install
   ```

> [!NOTE]
> pre-commit is Python package that can be installed via pip or any other Python package manager. You can also find it in our [requirements.txt](backend/requirements.txt) file.
>
> ```bash
> pip install pre-commit
> ```

> [!NOTE]
> If you are having issues with pre-commit and want to send along your changes regardless, you can ignore the pre-commit hooks via the following:
>
> ```bash
> git commit --no-verify -m "COMMIT_MESSAGE"
> ```

4. Commit your changes in logical chunks, and please try to adhere to [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

> [!NOTE]
> The following are tools and methods to help you write good commit messages âœ¨
>
> - [commitlint](https://commitlint.io/) helps write [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
> - Git's [interactive rebase](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/about-git-rebase) cleans up commits

5. Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch:

   ```bash
   git pull --rebase upstream <dev-branch>
   ```

6. Push your topic branch up to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin <topic-branch-name>
   ```

7. [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) with a clear title and description.

Thank you in advance for your contributions!

# Localization [`â‡§`](#contents)

Being an app that focusses on language learning, localization plays a big part in what Scribe will eventually be. Those interested in contributing to localization for the app are welcome to check related issues using the [`localization`](https://github.com/scribe-org/scri.be/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Alocalization) label, and are further welcome to open their own issues using the [localization](https://github.com/scribe-org/scri.be/issues/new?assignees=&labels=design&template=localization.yml) template!

# Documentation [`â‡§`](#contents)

Documentation is an invaluable way to contribute to coding projects as it allows others to more easily understand the project structure and contribute. Issues related to documentation are marked with the [`documentation`](https://github.com/scribe-org/scri.be/labels/documentation) label.

<a id="accessibility-"></a>

## Accessibility [`â‡§`](#contents)

Thank you for your interest in improving scri.be's accessibility. We want our platform to not only be usable for all people, but also to provide a welcoming environment within the development community for all. This section lists a few points to account for when checking accessibility constraints during development:

### Transitions

Users who have motion sickness have the ability to disable transitions and animations on their devices. We use the external dependency [reduced-motion](https://github.com/lucianmurmurache/reduced-motion) to disable transitions and animations in this case.

### Tab focusing

Tab focusing sadly doesn't work out of the box for many browsers. Chrome works great, but the following changes are needed for browsers to function properly with tabs. We'll test scrib.be against browsers with these settings with the assumption that people who need tab for more control of the interface will be able to activate them.

**Firefox**

- Go to `about:config`
- Search for `accessibility.tabfocus` and check that it's set to type `Boolean` with value `true`
- Remove it and select `Number` instead
- Click on the add button and then enter the value `7`

**Safari**

- Go to `Keyboard` in `System Preferences` for your computer (assuming it's a Mac)
- Select `Use keyboard navigation to move focus between controls` on Mac OS Catalina or `All controls` on earlier Mac OS versions
- In Safari go to `Settings`
- Go to the `Advanced` tab
- Select `Press Tab to highlight each item on a webpage`

Once the above steps are finished you should be able to use tab to navigate web pages :)

<a id="internationalization-"></a>

# Internationalization [`â‡§`](#contents)

scri.be uses [i18n-check](https://github.com/activist-org/i18n-check) to validate our internationalization key-value pairs. The basic command to check the i18n keys and values is:

```bash
# Note: You need to have installed the requirements-dev.txt file in your virtual environment.
i18n-check -a  # run all checks
```

You can also run individual checks. Please see the [documentation for i18n-check](https://i18n-check.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to learn more.

If you do need to edit the directories and files skipped by certain checks, then these edits can be made in the [.i18n-check.yaml](./.i18n-check.yaml) file. If you're having issues using `i18n-check`, please feel free to contact the team for support!

<a id="design-"></a>

# Design [`â‡§`](#contents)

<a href="https://www.figma.com/file/c8945w2iyoPYVhsqW7vRn6/scribe_public_designs?node-id=405%3A464"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scribe-org/Organization/main/resources/images/figma_logo.png" height="50" alt="Public Figma Designs" align="right"></a>

Designs for Scribe are done in the [public design file in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/c8945w2iyoPYVhsqW7vRn6/scribe_public_designs?node-id=405%3A464). Those interested in helping with Scribe's design are also welcome to share their ideas using the [design improvement](https://github.com/scribe-org/scri.be/issues/new?assignees=&labels=design&template=design_improvement.yml) template that makes an issue marked with the [`design`](https://github.com/scribe-org/scri.be/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Adesign) label.

All branding elements such as logos, icons, colors and fonts should follow those that are set out in [scribe-org/Organization](https://github.com/scribe-org/Organization). As the project is fully open source, these elements are also open for discussion. Efforts in making Scribe products professional with a distinct and cohesive identity are much appreciated!
